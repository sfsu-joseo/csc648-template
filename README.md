# Welcome to your CSC648-848-04 Team Repository

## Please when ready add your teams application URL or IP to the repository description. This will help with grading. Teams are expected to keep this value up to date.

## Please do the following steps after this repository is created.
1. Change the name of the repository from csc648-04-fa20-teamNN. All that needs to change is the NN to your respective team number. Team numbers whose value is less than 10, please pad with a 0. Ex team 1 is team01, team 11 is team11. Please make sure to also remove the username from the repository as well. Teams with incorrectly name repository will have points deducted from their milestone 0 grades.

1. PLEASE REMOVE THE USERNAME FROM THE REPOSITORY NAME!!!

2. Add ALL members of your team to this repository. For it to count, they must ACCEPT the invite.

3. Refactor this README file to become a profesional document for your application. Some info that it must have to get you started is the name of your application (this can be decided during M0), and additionally, the name, email (SFSU email), and role of each member of the team (this must be done after you create the repo). 

4. Create all the needed repository branches. As mandatory branches, you should have Master, Development and Testing branches in your repository. You can add more branches if you need them. The code in the Master branch must be all working code that passed all the tests. 

## Your code should be "self-documenting" (self explanatory code). In addition, code that performs complicated algorithms should include the appropiate comments. 

## Do not push code with bugs or with failed tests to the Master branch!!!. There are a few checking points during the semester where I check your Master branch to make sure that you only have working code there. 

## NO code needs to be stored in the root of your repository. You may rename the application folder if you like to your team's application name. But all source code related to your team's application should be stored inside the application folder.
